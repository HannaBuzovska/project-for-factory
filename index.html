                  Russian studio Asketik has designed a cafe with bright white interiors in Moscow, 
                  offset with many indoor plants to soften the industrial space.
                  Bloom-n-Brew occupies a former Soviet silk factory overhauled by Asketik, 
                  which also led the branding design, including a new logo and menu with a type-based graphic.
                  The cafe's name refers to the fragrant smell that is released when brewing a fresh cup of coffee.
                  Defined by high ceilings and hardly any internal walls, the space measures 1,238 square feet 
                  (115 square metres) and is located in the Russian capital's Factoria Park neighbourhood.

                  Areas for baristas and customers are arranged between various cabinets and exposed pillars, 
                  with large windows bringing light in.
                  White walls, white ceilings, and light grey floors create a stark backdrop, 
                  amplified by exposed pipes that have also been painted white.
                  "The inspiration was the history of the space," Asketik told Dezeen. 
                  "We wanted to save this industrial view and original purpose of the space."
